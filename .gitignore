# Dependencies for testing with Jest (e.g., config files if they are generated)
# If you have specific Jest config files that are generated and not committed, add them here.
# Example:
# jest.config.js
# coverage/

# Browser generated files for development builds/source maps
.parcel-cache/
*.map

# IDE and editor configuration
.vscode/
.idea/
*.sublime-project
*.sublime-workspace
*.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# OS generated files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Log files
*.log

# Temporary files
tmp/

# Build artifacts that are not in dist/ (e.g., intermediate build steps if any)
# Example:
# build/

# Git specific files that should not be committed (though typically handled by Git itself)
# .git/

# Environment variables (unless specifically configured to be committed)
# .env
# .env.local
# .env.development
# .env.production

# Test specific directories if they generate large or unneeded files
# For test output, consider committing results if useful for CI, or excluding specific temp files.
# If Jest output is in a directory other than 'coverage', add it here.
# Example:
# test-results/

# Potential additional files generated by Parcel or other tools
# If you encounter other temporary or build-related files, add them here.
# Example:
# service-worker.js (if generated and not meant to be committed directly)

# Asset cache busting files (if Parcel generates them separately and not part of dist/)
# Typically, Parcel handles this within the dist/ folder.

# Temporary files created during testing or development
# *.tmp
